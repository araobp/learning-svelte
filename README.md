# Learning Svelte

<img src="./docs/MyFirstSvelteApp.jpg" width=400>

I love VanillaJS, but as I'm building a generative AI app at work, the code is getting bloated and difficult to maintain. So, I'd like to learn a JavaScript framework. Svelte seems to be the simplest one, so I'll learn Svelte.

## Which one is better for me, Svelte or SvelteKit?

Since development will be done in combination with Flask in my job, Svelte will only be used on the frontend. However, SvelteKit includes convenient features such as a router. Therefore, I will use SvelteKit.

## Apps
